Download the ZIP file. Extract the files from the zip file to an easy to locate directory.
Open a terminal window (Command Prompt - Windows; Terminal - Mac) and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files. This is the directory with the pom.xml file that describes how to build and execute the sample webapp.
Execute the command mvn compile exec:java which first builds the application and then starts the webapp running in a local jetty web server.
There should be no errors during the compile, and the last thing you see should be the local jetty webserver starting on localhost:4567.
Open a web browser and navigate to localhost:4567. Use localhost:4567/127.0.0.x to connect to multiple sessions
